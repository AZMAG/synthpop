SynthPop is a rewrite of PopGen, using Pandas and focusing on performance and code reusability.

The implementation is based on the algorithms as described in this reference, and the paper as well as this repository should be cited if you use Synthpop:

The paper is available here: http://www.scag.ca.gov/Documents/PopulationSynthesizerPaper_TRB.pdf

The Synthpop code is a completely different software implementation than PopGen, but is based on the same design as described in the above paper.
